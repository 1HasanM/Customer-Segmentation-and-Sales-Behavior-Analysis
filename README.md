This project aims to gain a deep understanding of customer behavior using the provided shopping_trends.csv dataset. Within the scope of the project, customers were divided into four distinct segments based on characteristics such as age, spending amount, and number of previous purchases using the K-Means clustering algorithm. These segments are:

High-Value Loyal Customers: Represent the highest-spending and most loyal customer group.

Young and New Customers: This group has the youngest average age and represents potential growth.

Frequent Shoppers: These are customers who shop regularly and have a high purchasing frequency.

Budget-Oriented Mature Customers: This group is more mature but has a lower average spending rate.

In addition to this segmentation, we obtained important insights into customer purchasing trends by analyzing average spending amounts across the most profitable product categories (Clothing, Accessories) and different demographic characteristics (Gender, Location).
